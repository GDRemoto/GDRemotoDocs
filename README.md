# GDRemoto

GDRemoto is a networking solution for indie game developers.

With GDRemoto you can add user account authentication, storage, networking, and real-time data exchange into your indie apps / games. GDRemoto is developed by CodeCellGames and ForgedInteractive. GDRemoto is also partnered with BifrostGames, and Widby Games.

GDRemoto clients will have the base GDRemoto software run on our servers. However, any external headless instances can be ran on your own server hardware!
